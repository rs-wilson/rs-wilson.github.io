<br />
There is a low grumble from the group of players, who reluctantly start to fill in their character sheets with the minimal stats, skills, and abilities presented at the start of most games.&nbsp; Each looks longingly at the higher levels, and plots their eventual growth to <i>real</i> power, and <i>real </i>fun.<br />
<br />
Min/maxing is a term used to describe when players stretch their character building resources in order to maximize efficiency in one area by sacrificing efficiency in another.&nbsp; The most common example is a barbarian reducing his social abilities to get just a few more points into his strength.&nbsp; Or, a sneaky thief might sacrifice any usefulness in combat in order to ensure his pick-pocketing skills are top-notch.&nbsp; In both of these situations, the players focus on one thing they want to shine in, and sacrifice nearly everything else. <br />

<br />
But specializing is good! We want to be awesome at something! So is this a bad thing? Actually yes.&nbsp; While it's just fine that players want their characters to excel in areas the characters should excel at, there's two major problems with min/maxing:<br />
<br />
First, characters who only do one thing (e.g. I cast fire magic.) are generally considered 'flat'.&nbsp; They do not have that multi-dimensional mix that makes for a good story character.&nbsp; At first these characters are fun, but they quickly grow old as a game goes on, because they are a 'one-trick-pony'. <br />
<br />
Second, by sacrificing usefulness in other areas, this means that it's harder to get any sort of group teamwork.&nbsp; If the 'enforcer' can only fight, and the 'face' can only talk, and the 'hacker' can only hack... it means no one is actually playing the same game together.&nbsp; They might be physically present - but they're not <i>useful</i>.<br />

<br />
So how can we create a game that "minimizes", if you will, this issue?&nbsp; Let's start by looking at some mechanics that encourage min/maxing.&nbsp; The first gets back to my initial example; if characters do not feel special right off the bat, there's a tendency for players to min/max in an effort to make them special in <i>some</i> way (e.g. I have more strength than everyone else, yay!).&nbsp; Obviously this has a lot to do with setting (e.g. slaves trying to escape the coliseum vs. god-slayers looking to conquer the world), but its definitely a problem in a lot of games.<br />
<br />
Games do this to 'teach' new players; ease them into it.&nbsp; But I would argue it's more important to make new players feel awesome about playing, than to ensure they know every little detail of the rules.&nbsp; RPGs are complicated, and they are not going to get it all the first time anyway. <br />

Group</span></span></blockquote>
<br />
Another mechanic to look at is <i>prerequisites </i>for skills and abilities, which can be a huge source of min/maxing.&nbsp; This is a mechanic that says I can have X, but only if I have Y.&nbsp; Well, what if I don't want Y?&nbsp; Why can't I have X because Z also makes sense?&nbsp; Prerequisites can add strategy to character-building, which is normally a good thing, unless it pigeon-holes players into only going down one path.&nbsp; If you're going to have prerequisites in your games at all, ensure that they are <i>generic</i>, such that there are multiple paths available to achieve the same end goal<span style="color: #0000ee;">.</span><br />
<br />
Lastly, RPGs that use XP or some other point-buy system encourage min/maxing by letting players only buy one thing at a time.&nbsp; Initially these systems seem great, because you can customize your character to whatever end.&nbsp; But this almost always boils down to players "customizing" all of their points into a single area.<br />

Players can <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/3e1xdj/minmaxing_is_ruining_every_game_i_play/" target="_blank">help themselves</a> by purposefully trying to not min/max, but that can have just the same effects as min/maxing!&nbsp; If you are mediocre at everything, you're now useful in none.&nbsp; This creates dull characters to play, which is rarely fun for anyone.&nbsp; What we're really looking for is multi-tiered characters, with many strengths and a few different weaknesses.<br />

<br />
So I believe it's up to the game to help. Let's look at some mechanics that actually help alleviate min/maxing. 
The most common one is surprising "levels".&nbsp; Character levels in RPGs allow characters to grow both in combat abilities and non-combat abilities.&nbsp; Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e (so far) has done a great job at giving players both <i>choice</i> in their levels and <i>balance</i> in the abilities presented.&nbsp; Usually, there is both a combat bonus and a non-combat bonus within each character choice, including the generic 'feats' used at higher levels.<br />
<br />
Another mechanic that helps our cause is <i>not</i> rewarding XP for individual situations.&nbsp; It's easy to pick on combat, and say that because we give XP for killing elves, the players are always going to kill elves.&nbsp; But the same is true for any system which uses a 'use-it-to-up-it' system.&nbsp; If talking to the bartender gives you XP towards your talking skills, I'm going to sit there and talk to the bartender until I'm actually good at it.&nbsp; A lot of GMs already realize this, and often give out an equal amount of XP at the end of any given session or major plot point.<br />
<br />
D&amp;D brings about balance by ensuring that the <i>combat</i> focused abilities are all equal in power (as much as possible anyway).&nbsp; They've openly declared that they do not balance non-combat abilities, as this would be not only extremely difficult, but simply not that interesting.&nbsp; For a combat-focused game, this makes sense, but I think we can do better.<br />
<br />
I suggest that, much like generalizing character 'stats', that we categorize XP into common groups that make the most sense for our game.&nbsp; For example, we could have combat XP, which is earned through combat, and spent towards combat-focused abilities, and then have 'role-play' XP, which is earned through solving issues or completing quests, and spent on non-combat abilities.<br />
<br />
This system balances<i> </i><i>power</i> with <i>utility</i>.&nbsp; It keeps the power gamers happy by ensuring they can min/max their combat abilities without sacrificing some of the extra fluff, and it keeps the role-players happy by ensuring they don't have to suck at combat to be awesome at diplomacy.&nbsp; As an added bonus, it more or less forces players to have the multi-tiered characters that usually make for a well-rounded story, where everyone at the table is doing <i>something</i> no matter what is going on.<br />
<br />
We know that we could make every skill individually level up (Oblivion style), but that'll end poorly, as we've discussed.&nbsp; Instead, let's just take it one step further and look at the three "Pillars of Adventure" defined by D&amp;D: exploration, social interaction, and combat.&nbsp; I would argue that these are excellent categories for XP, and that if we want everyone to be useful everywhere, that this would be the way to go.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, we have to be careful, or no one is going to feel special against anyone else in the party...<br />
<br />
For Hostargo, action/combat is going to be a large part (at least 50%) of the game.&nbsp; As such, I believe I'm going to implement a double XP system: one combat and one non-combat, to be spent on their respective areas.&nbsp; However, to minimize having one area excel over another, I'm going to give out a "star rating" at the end of each adventure (1-5), and give each player that much XP to work with in both categories, effectively forcing them to spend the same amount in the two different areas.<br />
