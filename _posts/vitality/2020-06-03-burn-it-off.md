How exactly do you lose fat? Through your [sweat and breath](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/where-does-body-fat-go-when-you-lose-weight/)! The more you _sweat_, the more you _breathe hard_, and the faster your _heart pumps_, the more weight you'll lose.

The easiest way for me to do this was to get into running. But any sort of endurance, aerobic, or other heart-rate-increasing exercise will do. This sucks. I know it does. 

**But you have to find a way to make it suck less.**

You have to make the promise of feeling better worth it. For me, I got a nice pair of wireless earbuds, a running belt to hold my phone, and a variety of audio books that keep me both entertained and educated.

This is about you. It's about your self improvement. Keep your reasons for exercise in mind. You can do it!

Other great choices are:
* Biking
* Climbing
* Dancing
* Swimming
