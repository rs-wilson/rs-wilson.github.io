Sugar is as addicting as cocaine. It is as harmful as cocaine; it just takes decades to kill you. I might be exaggerating, but this is the mindset you need to overcome your sugar addiction. This is an intervention. You have a problem, because it's hard in this country to NOT have it. It's hidden everywhere and in everything, and I encourage you to be on the lookout for it.

__Avoid added sugars at all costs.__

There's only one solution to this, and it's the hardest thing to do on this page: give it all up. Don't be a person that buys chocolate, eats cookies, or bakes cake. Refuse to eat these things, because simply put, you don't need them. Pleasure can be had in other ways. For example, treat yourself to an apple after dinner, or when you need a mental boost.
