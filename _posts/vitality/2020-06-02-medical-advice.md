If you're looking for real medical information, please don't just google your symptoms. Speak with a real doctor, if possible. Otherwise, visit [familydoctor.org](https://familydoctor.org/) to do your research. It was recommended to me by a doctor friend, and is as unbiased as possible.

My best advice is this: do research. Find information from unbiased sources who are truly looking to help.
