I have been a hobbyist game designer since I was a little kid. While I chose computer science as my career, I continue to tinker with games, mechanics, stories, and surreal experiences of all kinds.  

I have attempted to record some of the best lessons I've learned over the years here on my [blog](/blog/categories#game-design).  

On this page is my hand-curated list of favorite topics:
* [Styles of Fun](/blog/game-design/styles-of-fun/)
* [Uncertainty in Games](/blog/game-design/uncertainty-mini-series/)
* [The Worst Game Mechanic](/blog/game-design/the-worst-game-mechanic/)
* [Role-playing while Roll-playing](/blog/game-design/rewarding-roleplaying-enjoying-rollplaying/)
