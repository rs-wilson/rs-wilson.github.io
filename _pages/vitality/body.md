My best advice is this: do research. Find information from unbiased sources who are truly looking to help.

## Getting Started
Head over to [ahealthiermichigan.org](https://www.ahealthiermichigan.org/) to get started on your new vitality education. These folks are doing a great job, and have more honest material than I could ever dream of pumping out. It can be overwhelming, I know, so feel free to keep scrolling down to find what has worked for me.

This journey is about making a __lifestyle change__. If you're not committed to change, then nothing is going to change with you.

## Medical Advice
If you're looking for real medical information, please don't just google your symptoms. Speak with a real doctor, if possible. Otherwise, visit [familydoctor.org](https://familydoctor.org/) to do your research. It was recommended to me by a doctor friend, and is as unbiased as possible.

## Weight Loss

Weight loss is very simple. Burn more calories than you take in, and you will lose weight. What's hard is:
* Managing hunger.
* Kicking your sugar addiction.
* Eating right.
* Staying active.

Through the sections below, I hope to help you as much as I can with these difficult tasks.

## Fitness

Exercise is tough. But without it, you _will not hit your goals_. Moving is your only defense against aging, and getting fit not only helps you lose the weight, its the necessary component to keeping it off.

Bonus: working out helps you cope with stress, sleep better, and enjoy resting more!

### Burn it off: Run!
How exactly do you lose fat? Through your [sweat and breath](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/where-does-body-fat-go-when-you-lose-weight/)! The more you _sweat_, the more you _breathe hard_, and the faster your _heart pumps_, the more weight you'll lose.

The easiest way for me to do this was to get into running. But any sort of endurance, aerobic, or other heart-rate-increasing exercise will do. This sucks. I know it does. But you have to find a way to make it suck less. You have to make the promise of feeling better worth it. For me, I got a nice pair of wireless earbuds, a running belt to hold my phone, and a variety of audio books that keep me both entertained and educated.

### Keep it off: Muscle!
Building muscle gives you a greater calorie burn rate per day, _even when you don't exercise_. I have found the [5x5](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/building-muscle/a757350/why-5x5-is-the-ultimate-way-to-build-lean-muscle/) strategy to be both effective and rewarding.

Do 5 sets of 5 reps of whatever strength exercise you can. Three times a week.

__Always be progressing.__ Start with 1 exercise; maybe push-ups. Then add another. Then add another. Then get some weights. Get a bench.

__Mix it up__. Routines are good. Habits are great. But your body will be more rounded if you do different things to work it out.

You will start to feel it after about a month. That's a long time to do something with little results, but do it for a month, and one day it will hit you: you are doing more, lifting harder, and working less. And that feeling is going to be worth it.

### Keep it up: Habits!
The only way this is going to work is if you form good habits. This means making exercise a part of your life. You don't have to be a fitness buff, you just have to think of it as if it is as necessary as eating. Because it is!

If you need help forming good habits, or kicking bad ones, I recommend reading or listening to [Atomic Habbits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits).

## Healthy Eating

We have two goals: take in less, and take in only what is right.

### The Right Diet

We want to get away from the Standard American Diet (SAD) of nutrient-robbed grains, artery-clogging meat, and fat-building drinks. Don't be SAD.

Instead, follow the [the mediterranean diet](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/nutrition-basics/mediterranean-diet):

* Eat mostly vegetables
* Eat plenty of whole gains, nuts, and seeds
* Eat some healthy meats, such as fish and chicken

### Proper Proportions

To cut down on eating, we're going to back off slowly, hour by hour, with "one easy trick":
1. Serve yourself your normal portions. 
1. Drink a huge glass of water.
1. Only eat half. Stop as soon as you are about half done.
1. Sit back, relax, and drink another huge glass of water.
1. Let others finish eating. Let your stomach settle.
1. Pack up your second half, and save it for later.
1. Try to go for as long as you can without eating.
1. When you're hungry again, eat your leftovers!

If you get into this habit, you can make a game out of seeing how long you can go without eating your leftovers. You might start out with just a few minutes (eat your second half instead of dessert!), but you should try to grow to an hour, then 2 hours, then 3, then 4. Eventually, you will be able to save half of your meal for the next meal, and you've officially won!

### Macronutrients
Getting enough, and getting only enough, is the key to the "balanced" diet. To do this, we need to understand what our bodies actually need.

* Lots of fiber.
* Plenty of fat.
* Complete proteins.
* Vitamins and minerals.

#### [Carbs & Fiber](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diet-and-weight-loss/carbohydrates--good-or-bad-for-you)

Carbs provide a steady source of energy throughout the day. We want to eat them to prevent our body from breaking itself down for energy instead.

Simple carbs, such as sugar, and refined carbs, such as white rice or bread, lack any nutrients to accompany their calories.

Plant fiber and whole grains, on the other hand, are necessary for proper digestion and blood sugar level control.

#### Sodium & Potassium

Our body needs sodium and potassium to perform a variety of necessary functions, such as moving! But, we only need about 500mg of sodium per day, and about 3000mg of potassium per day. Unfortunately, the SAD diet has those two numbers flopped, leading to high blood pressure and fatigue. But it's difficult to know what foods have exactly how much sodium or potassium, so here's some good rules-of-thumb:

For lower salt:
* Opt for no-salt spice blends.
* Go easy on the sauce; __really easy__.
* Avoid baked goods, especially fluffy, white breads.

For higher potassium:
* Eat dark, leafy greens.
* Eat legumes, potatoes, and bananas.
* Eat juicy fruits, like melons.

If you are able to look at packages, remember that a standard calorie diet is about 2000. So, compare sodium and potassium to the calories of the food! We want:
* Sodium to be less than calories.
* Potassium to be higher than calories.

Following this simple comparison rule will help steer you towards healthier choices and more balanced meals.

#### [Fat](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-truth-about-fats-bad-and-good)
Turns out, our bodies are actually pretty good at processing fat. But the types of fat matters a lot, and we still have to watch not to drown ourselves in it. Feel free to cook with oil, use it on salads, and eat high-fat foods like fish and peanuts.

* _Trans Fat_ is horrible, and America has finally put it behind us in most cases. If you do see it though, beware.  
* _Saturated Fat_ is still hotly debated. I encourage you to do your own research in this area, but in general, minimize your saturated fat (sorry coconuts!).  
* _Mono Unsaturated Fat_ is the good stuff.  
* _Poly Unsaturated Fat_ comes in two main forms, and you need both (omega-3 and omega-6). Also the good stuff.  

#### [Complete Proteins](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/do-i-need-to-worry-about-eating-complete-proteins/)

Protein is essential, and a complete protein is one that has all 9 amino acids that our body doesn't produce on its own.

Eating plants for protein is possible, but not easy. Luckily, even just a serving or two of animal meats are an easy checkbox for this category. The concern with eating animals, of course, is that [fish contain mercury](https://www.michigan.gov/documents/mdch/MDCH_EAT_SAFE_FISH_GUIDE_-_SOUTHWEST_MI_WEB_455360_7.pdf), and other meats are high in bad cholesterol. Luckily, there's a couple easy rules we can follow to keep ourselves rocking.

* Eat a couple servings of protein each day.
* Eat a couple servings of fish, such as salmon, a week.  
* Limit eating lean white meat to a single meal each day.
* Rarely if ever eat red meat or shellfish.
* Always feel free to eat __soy__, as this is a complete protein source (tofu, edamame, soymilk).

#### Vitamins and Minerals

You can dive __deep__ into the science of vitamins and minerals. But there's some simple suggestions that will navigate you through life just fine:
* Eat a lot of dark, leafy vegetables.
* Eat as many different colors as possible.

Spinach is your friend. Superfoods aren't a joke.

### Sugar
Sugar is as addicting as cocaine. It is as harmful as cocaine; it just takes decades to kill you. I might be exaggerating, but this is the mindset you need to overcome your sugar addiction. This is an intervention. You have a problem, because it's hard in this country to NOT have it. It's hidden everywhere and in everything, and I encourage you to be on the lookout for it.

__Avoid added sugars at all costs.__

There's only one solution to this, and it's the hardest thing to do on this page: give it all up. Don't be a person that buys chocolate, eats cookies, or bakes cake. Refuse to eat these things, because simply put, you don't need them. Pleasure can be had in other ways. For example, treat yourself to an apple after dinner, or when you need a mental boost.
