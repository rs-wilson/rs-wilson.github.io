The only way this is going to work is if you form good habits. This means making exercise a part of your life. You don't have to be a fitness buff, you just have to think of it as if it is as necessary as eating. Because it is!

If you need help forming good habits, or kicking bad ones, I recommend reading or listening to [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits).
