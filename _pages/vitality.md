If you've ever wanted to get rid of the rotten feeling in your stomach, the sweat-inducing anxiety in your heart, or the multiple bowling balls worth of fat off your body, you are not alone. But there's an insane amount of health and wellness advice out there, and it's hard to know what you should actually do, and how.

There is no easy answer. I am not here to tell you another internet secret. But I can attempt to help you figure out what is important, and arm you with simple, most-likely-true knowledge that has helped me through the struggles of modern adult living.

Stay tuned. While you are waiting though, head over to [ahealthiermichigan.org](https://www.ahealthiermichigan.org/) to get started on your new vitality education. These folks are doing a great job.

If you're looking for real medical information, please don't just google your symptoms. Speak with a real doctor, if possible. Otherwise, visit [familydoctor.org](https://familydoctor.org/) to do your research. It was recommended to me by a doctor friend, and contains _mostly unbias_ information.
