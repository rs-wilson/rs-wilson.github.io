Greetings!

I am a software developer by day, game designer by night. I am passionate about systems; designing them, fixing them, and tweaking them to perfection. From the slickest new tech to the hottest new games, I thrive in the exploration of the imagination. I aim to be just like my work: efficient, streamlined, and always improving.

If you're interested in my work as a developer or agile team leader, please check out my LinkedIn profile or shoot me an e-mail with your opportunity. 

If you're interested in my work as a designer, check out my game links to see an example of how I think. E-mail is the best way to get a hold of me, so don't be shy!

Thanks for stopping by!

Cheers,<br>
-Ryan-
