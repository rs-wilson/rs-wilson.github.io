Even the chainmail bikini usually gives an RPG hero a boost in "armor": that generic value of how protected a character is.&nbsp; In a lot of games, there's no reason not to want the highest protection, and in others, the trade off is a simple protection vs. speed.&nbsp; In order to have more interesting choices in armor, we should look at different <i>types of damage</i>.<br />
<br />
Many others have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/2uon64/rpg_design_help_me_solve_my_armor_conundrum/" target="_blank">contemplated the various armor styles</a> in RPGs, and they boil down to three distinct effects against incoming damage: evasion, reduction, or absorption.&nbsp; Evasion armor helps attacks miss you (e.g. D&amp;D: a sword bounces off of plate), reduction negates the damage altogether (e.g. Shadowrun: lowered damage total), and absorption transfers the damage from one source to another (e.g. FATE: from physical wounds to stress).&nbsp; There are pros and cons to each, but the <b>reality of armor</b> is that it usually does <i>all three</i>.<br />
<br />
The main issue with straight damage vs. armor is that there are multiple different types of attacks that are effective against multiple types of armor.&nbsp; A dagger slips underneath the platemail, but gets slowed by a layer of padding.&nbsp; A bullet slams into a body vest, knocking its wearer off 
their feet. Most attacks have <i>some effect</i> of <b>wearing down their target</b>.<br />
<br />
In order to more interestingly simulate armor in a game, and without making it overly complicated, some games have given armor bonuses against the "core" types of attacks: slashing, piercing, and crushing.&nbsp; But these are very specific, and don't work well as generic damage types.&nbsp; Instead, I'd like to suggest using "lethal" and "non-lethal" damage types.&nbsp; In some games, non-lethal damage is an add-on mechanic only used for fist fights or the occasional status effect.&nbsp; However, if we define every type of attack with <i>both lethal and non-lethal </i>properties, we can come up with something very interesting.<br />
<br />
<b>Lethal damage</b> is the cutting/piercing power of an attack.&nbsp; It's the damage that, given no protection at all, drains the life force from blood-bag humans.&nbsp; <b>Non-lethal damage</b> is the force behind an attack.&nbsp; Most attacks have it, but it hits in a different form than lethal damage.&nbsp; It generally hurts more (I thought about calling it "pain" damage...), and it saps a character's energy, focus, and balance. <br />
<br />
For this to work, we have to assume two properties in our RPG: "health" and "energy", or some version of it.&nbsp; Lethal damage gets through to health, and non-lethal gets through to fatigue.&nbsp; A sword swing, for example, may have 5L and 5NL damage, an arrow may have 7L, 3NL, and a hammer may have 1L, 10NL.&nbsp; As you might expect, once a character is out of energy, that damage starts rolling over to health.<br />
<br />
If we have these two types of damage, we also need two types of protection: <b>armor</b> and <b>padding</b>. Armor will reduce the damage from lethal attacks, and padding will reduce the damage from non-lethal attacks. I think this best simulates both the <i>evasion</i> and <i>absorption</i> properties of protection by completely negating the effect of low-damage attacks and splitting the possible effects of attacks with this dual-type system.<br />
<br />
Let's look at some extreme examples:<br />
<br />
Plate vs. Blade: The high armor of plate protects it against the cut of the blade, but not the swing of the metal.&nbsp; A hammer would be more effective, but the sword swinger still slaps a bit of wind out of the wearer.<br />
<br />
Plate with Padding: "I didn't even feel that."<br />
<br />
Bullet vs. Body Vest:&nbsp; The body armor stops all of the "lethal" damage 
behind the bullet, but the force of the impact still hurts like a bitch. <br />
<br />
Boxing: The attacker's gloves acts as padding, turning a bone-on-bone situation into a pure 'force' attack.&nbsp; This lets the competitors beat the crap out of each other without fear of getting actually injured (obvious exaggeration, but that <i>is</i> why they wear gloves).<br />
<br />
The line of "overly complicated" is blurry, and very much open to individual preference.&nbsp; To me, that line is crossed whenever a system introduces hit locations or weak points in defenses (for the players - at least).&nbsp; I much prefer critical hits and misses, to keep things exciting while simulating that "perfect hit".&nbsp; In this type of system, the attacker might have a choice for critical hits either A) increasing damage total, B) bypassing armor, or C) bypassing padding, or some combination thereof.<br />
<br />
The straightforward Lethal -&gt; Armor -&gt; Health and Non-Lethal -&gt; Padding -&gt; Energy damage system I propose here could be what I use in my upcoming game Hostargo.&nbsp; But I can't help but feel that, while this has solved my gripes about damage and armor in other games, it's going to be too much.&nbsp; The extra definition of each attack, plus the additional subtraction and rollover of damage means that this would add quite a crunch to whatever system it's implemented in.<br />
