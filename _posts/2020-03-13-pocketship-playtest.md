The newest version of Pocket Ships hit an awesome sweet spot today, with an epic battle between two of my co-workers that went back and forth, up and down, and finally ended in a surprising twist of fate to declare the winner.

Of note, players loved the new shield generator. If activated, it brings back ALL shields on the outer pieces. This makes for brilliant swings in defense, and a dynamic value for other pieces (e.g. keeping the shield generator alive).

Also importantly, the beam cannon is exactly as impactful as it should be. It is a huge start, but very quickly becomes risky as the inner system becomes exposed. Whether or not it is worth the risk is always an interesting decision, and when someone starts charging it, it makes the next couple of turns incredibly intense!

However, the end of the game isn't quite as epic and awesome as it could be. When someone rolls NOTHING, it sucks, and I think that just keeping going is better than the game ending right there. But that means it could also drag on as nearly completely busted ships poke at each other until someone loses all of their weapons. It is less epic than getting wiped out, but I think ending the game earlier than later is still the right choice, I just wonder if there's a way to make it feel better all around.
