## Tabletop Prototypes

I am always tinkering with new game ideas, and would love feedback on my current projects!<br>
Please check out what I have and feel free to print, play, share, and comment!

### [Pocket Ships](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ceg5QEPDz966X8FhtqUvPT5HsvUDsxpNBNMj5Pr5HxY/edit?usp=sharing)

If you've got 15-20 minutes to kill, this game can fill it with a pleasant mix of variety-through-dice-rolling and tough, tactical decision making.

### [Archdruid](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Fy0BB05uV7QyhGVbcp_b9eURQWbR-XQE/view?usp=sharing)

In Archdruid, players will race to clear the forest of demonic corruption by siphoning magic from and then taming fey and demon creatures. The player that best uses their tamed creature's abilities will be awarded the prestigious title of _Archdruid_!

The game is a brain-burning spacial-puzzle and hand management game. Through simple rules that are explained in about 5 minutes, players can jump right in. But with strategic hand building, and a tactical movement and collection puzzle, many styles of gamers will enjoy Archdruid's quickly ramping complexity.

This game rewards clever use of each card's "recover" ability. Cards can only be used for the game's main actions once, and are down on the table until they are recovered back into the player's hand. Each card has a unique way it is recovered; some sort of cost that _must_ be paid. However, most of these "costs" can be twisted to the player's benefit, giving players situational options to get ahead of their competition.

## Tabletop RPGs

I have spent a huge chunk of my game design studies focusing on tabletop RPGs. Below are my favorite among those I have created.

### [SUPER MEGA ROBOT FRIENDS!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qSADVIii12XD68HrQIpYlPlGhWdqbTxhpivg0M8chkw/edit?usp=sharing)
A hectic, one-act style RPG about a group of combining-robot pilots that are forced to work through their interpersonal issues in order to succeed.

This game was completed as part of the 200-word RPG challenge. It was a ton of fun to make, a challenge to slim & trim, and absolutely worth the half hour or so it takes to play!

### [South of West](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LBfqDMV0RJDw3J1FSjEvdijDj-whofiFYyjLwfoVwfk/edit?usp=sharing)
Be a Bardito, Salsarer, Sour Cream Slinger, or any of the other 5 playbooks you'll find in SoW, and survive the chaos that always seems to seep into the queso at _Adjacent to the Border_!

SoW is a _West of Loathing_ inspired RPG that hacks the popular __PbtA__ engine to create a slapstick comedy adventure about food, food fights, and food puns. It is best for slightly longer one-shot style games, able to handle you as long as you can handle it!

### [Hostargo](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wq_7NfL8TqmlU-XkRmGhMqxeM1OJgu1plZb5UEipLGg/edit?usp=sharing)
My white whale project of many years, I have poured my best ideas and hardest effort into forging the best TTRPG I can. And it's not finished. But, feel free to check out what I have, and follow me on our [blog](/blog) as I explore the last legs of this epic journey.
