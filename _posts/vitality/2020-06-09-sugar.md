**is as addicting as cocaine**. It is as harmful as cocaine; it just takes decades to kill you. I might be exaggerating, but this is the mindset you need to overcome your sugar addiction. This is an intervention. You have a problem, because it's hard in this world to NOT have it. 

Sugar is hidden everywhere and in everything, and I encourage you to be on the lookout for it. It is our greatest desire, but should be our greatest fear.

**Avoid added sugars at all costs.** Because they add nothing but weight, lethargy, and disease to you.

There's only one solution to this, and it's the hardest thing to do: give it all up. Don't be a person that buys chocolate, eats cookies, or bakes cake. Refuse to eat these things, because simply put, you don't need them! Pleasure can be had in other ways. For example, treat yourself to some fruit after dinner, or when you need a mental boost. Reward yourself with tasty health foods, rather than turning to baked goods and candy bars. Steel yourself.
