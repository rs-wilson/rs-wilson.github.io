We want to get away from the Standard American Diet (SAD) of nutrient-robbed grains, artery-clogging meat, and fat-building drinks. Don't be SAD.

Instead, follow the [the mediterranean diet](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/nutrition-basics/mediterranean-diet):

* Eat mostly vegetables
* Eat plenty of whole gains, nuts, and seeds
* Eat some healthy meats, such as fish and chicken
