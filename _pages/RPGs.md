I have spent a huge chunk of my game design studies focusing on tabletop RPGs. Below are my favorite among those I have created.

## [SUPER MEGA ROBOT FRIENDS!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qSADVIii12XD68HrQIpYlPlGhWdqbTxhpivg0M8chkw/edit?usp=sharing)
A hectic, one-act style RPG about a group of combining-robot pilots that are forced to work through their interpersonal issues in order to succeed.

This game was completed as part of the 200-word RPG challenge. It was a ton of fun to make, a challenge to slim & trim, and absolutely worth the half hour or so it takes to play!

## [South of West](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LBfqDMV0RJDw3J1FSjEvdijDj-whofiFYyjLwfoVwfk/edit?usp=sharing)
Be a Bardito, Salsarer, Sour Cream Slinger, or any of the other 5 playbooks you'll find in SoW, and survive the chaos that always seems to seep into the queso at _Adjacent to the Border_!

SoW is a _West of Loathing_ inspired RPG that hacks the popular __PbtA__ engine to create a slapstick comedy adventure about food, food fights, and food puns. It is best for slightly longer one-shot style games, able to handle you as long as you can handle it!

My white whale project of many years, I have poured my best ideas and hardest effort into forging the best TTRPG I can. And it's not finished. But, feel free to check out what I have, and follow me on our [blog](/blog) as I explore the last legs of this epic journey.
